# Research Proposal: Investigating Interaction Patterns in Long-Timescale Agentic Systems

## 1. Introduction

The field of artificial intelligence has made remarkable strides in developing systems capable of sophisticated knowledge representation, reasoning, and task execution. However, a significant limitation persists in current AI architectures: their inability to effectively operate over extended timescales while maintaining goal-directed behavior and meaningful human collaboration. This research proposes to investigate the patterns of interaction that emerge in agentic systems designed to operate over prolonged periods (days, weeks, or months) through the development and analysis of an experimental plant monitoring system called Garden AI.

## 2. Background and Significance

### 2.1 The Cognitive Light Cone

All cognitive actors operate within what biologist Michael Levin terms a "cognitive light cone" - the scope of the largest goal they can engage with based on their substrate, input/output mechanisms, and operational timescale. Current AI systems typically operate within a narrow cognitive light cone constrained by:

1. Short-term interaction patterns (chat-based turns)
2. Limited tool access (primarily informational)
3. Inability to maintain context and goal orientation across extended periods
4. Lack of mechanisms for asynchronous human collaboration

These constraints fundamentally limit the domains in which AI systems can effectively operate, restricting them to problems that can be solved within short timeframes and with immediate human guidance.

### 2.2 The Knowledge-Goal Gap

A critical distinction exists between systems designed for knowledge management (explaining, summarizing, analyzing) and those capable of pursuing overarching goals that require knowledge acquisition, reasoning, and action as components of execution. Current systems excel at the former but struggle with the latter, particularly when goals require sustained attention over longer periods.

### 2.3 Timescale as a Critical Dimension

Time represents a crucial dimension in cognitive systems that has been underexplored in AI research. The ability to incorporate new information, adjust strategies, and maintain goal orientation across varying timescales is essential for addressing complex problems. Natural processes like plant growth operate on timescales that are slow by computational standards but rapid enough to observe meaningful patterns within a research timeframe, making them ideal for studying long-timescale agent behavior.

## 3. Research Questions

This research aims to address the following questions:

1. What interaction patterns emerge between AI agents and human collaborators when operating over extended timescales?
2. How do these patterns differ from those observed in short-term, synchronous interactions?
3. What architectural components are necessary to support effective long-timescale agentic behavior?
4. How does the agent's ability to store and retrieve historical context affect its decision-making and goal pursuit?
5. What mechanisms facilitate effective asynchronous collaboration between humans and AI systems?

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Experimental System: Garden AI

We propose developing Garden AI, an experimental plant monitoring system that combines edge computing with cloud infrastructure and AI to provide automated plant care assistance. The system will:

1. Capture regular images of plants at scheduled intervals (1-2 times daily)
2. Analyze plant health using Amazon Bedrock Nova Pro foundation model
3. Maintain historical records of plant development and AI observations
4. Communicate asynchronously with human gardeners through a web interface
5. Track all interactions, decisions, and outcomes over the plant's growth cycle

### 4.2 System Architecture

The Garden AI system will be implemented using the following components:

- **Edge Device**: Raspberry Pi with camera module for image capture
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS services including S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, EventBridge
- **AI Analysis**: Amazon Bedrock Nova Pro foundation model
- **Communication**: Web application interface for asynchronous interaction
- **Data Storage**: Structured database for plant status, AI summaries, and message history

### 4.3 Data Collection

The research will collect the following data:

1. **Temporal Interaction Patterns**: Frequency, duration, and nature of AI-human interactions
2. **Decision Quality**: Accuracy and effectiveness of AI recommendations over time
3. **Context Utilization**: How effectively the AI leverages historical information
4. **Goal Alignment**: Consistency of AI actions with the overarching goal of plant health
5. **Adaptation Patterns**: How the AI adjusts strategies based on plant response and human feedback

### 4.4 Analysis Methods

Data will be analyzed using:

1. Temporal pattern analysis to identify interaction rhythms and cycles
2. Qualitative coding of AI-human communications to identify emerging patterns
3. Comparative analysis between short-term and long-term decision quality
4. Evaluation of goal persistence and drift over extended periods

## 5. Expected Outcomes and Contributions

This research is expected to yield the following contributions:

1. **Architectural Insights**: Identification of essential components for long-timescale agentic systems
2. **Interaction Patterns**: Documentation of novel interaction patterns that emerge in asynchronous, extended collaborations
3. **Design Principles**: Guidelines for designing AI systems capable of operating effectively across varying timescales
4. **Domain Expansion**: Framework for expanding the cognitive light cone of AI systems to address problems requiring extended temporal engagement
5. **Practical Applications**: Demonstration of a functional system that can maintain goal-directed behavior while accommodating the natural rhythm of biological processes

## 6. Theoretical Framework

The research will draw upon several theoretical frameworks:

### 6.1 Cognitive Light Cone Theory

Building on Michael Levin's concept, we will explore how expanding an agent's temporal domain affects its problem-solving capabilities and interaction patterns.

### 6.2 Extended Agency

Drawing from theories of extended cognition, we will investigate how an agent's capabilities are enhanced through persistent storage of observations and plans.

### 6.3 Asynchronous Collaboration Models

Examining how effective collaboration can occur when participants operate on different timescales and with different availability patterns.

## 7. Implementation Plan

The research will proceed through the following phases:

1. **System Development** (2 months): Implementation of the Garden AI architecture
2. **Pilot Testing** (1 month): Initial deployment with rapid iteration to address technical issues
3. **Primary Experiment** (6 months): Extended operation covering multiple plant growth cycles
4. **Data Analysis** (3 months): Comprehensive analysis of collected interaction data
5. **Theory Development** (2 months): Formulation of principles for long-timescale agentic systems

## 8. Broader Impacts

This research has potential implications for numerous domains requiring long-term goal pursuit, including:

1. **Scientific Research**: Supporting extended experimental processes
2. **Healthcare**: Monitoring chronic conditions and treatment adherence
3. **Education**: Providing sustained learning support across academic terms
4. **Environmental Monitoring**: Tracking ecological changes over seasons or years
5. **Project Management**: Assisting with complex projects spanning months or years

## 9. Conclusion

The proposed research addresses a fundamental limitation in current AI systems: their inability to effectively operate over extended timescales while maintaining goal-directed behavior. By developing and studying Garden AI, we aim to identify the architectural components, interaction patterns, and design principles necessary to expand the temporal domain of AI systems, enabling them to address problems that require sustained attention and adaptation over longer periods.

This work represents a shift from viewing AI primarily as a tool for immediate knowledge management to understanding it as a potential collaborator in extended goal pursuit - a transition that may significantly expand the range of problems AI can meaningfully address.
